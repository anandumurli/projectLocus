### Project Locus
## Introduction
This is the project that focuses on creating a question bank, that can be used to later pick out questions that will be coming together to set up a question paper. This is my vision about such a system and there will be tweaks that will be coming as the project continues.

## Objective
With this project we are trying to build an interactive application to allow teaching professionals to easily build a question paper of any decided format by regularly updating a database with set questions.

The project aims at making the painstaking process of generating question paper a bit more easier by automatically selecting questions based on the criteria provided by the user.



## Versioning and Version Control.
We will have three set of branches through out the repository.
The first will be the main branch, second would be the progress branch and finally v_X.x branch.

As we progress through various versions you will find the current work in progress version in the progress branch.

The main branch would be the last worked on version with most appropriate set of changes made to it.

Current version details - The current of the project is just an MVP for the idea.

Version 0.0 (v_0.0) - The first version of the project. An MVP to get started with the project.
